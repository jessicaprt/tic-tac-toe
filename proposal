Project title: The impossible tic tac toe game

Description:
The game follows the rule as the classical tic tac toe game. That is, two players,
 X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing
 three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
 We build this game with GUI method. So that we can open the game in a single window with the command
 on the terminal. Also, there are two steps to start the game. The first step is to choose the the pattern
 of the player (X or O), and the second step is to choose who plays first. That is, the player or the computer.
There are two buttons on the game window. One is quit, when clicking it, the window will be closed.
The other is new game. When playing the game, if the player wants to start a new one, just click this button.
